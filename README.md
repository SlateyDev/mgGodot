# Monogame Godot

This project is an attempt to replicate Godot functionalities in Monogame.

The basic idea is I have used several game engines and wanted to make one myself. I decided I would base it on
Godot which I like and try to replicate the functionalities to make my own game engine. The engine tries to
bring as much of the godot functionality across so it can be programmed using C# using a familiar API.

My hopes for the engine is that someday, I will be able to make a game in Godot, and easily transfer that game
to monogame with little to no changes to the underlying C# game code that was made under Godot. This will
improve platform support for anything I make and give me the option of implementing other game systems easier
(such as a different physics system, or navigation system).
